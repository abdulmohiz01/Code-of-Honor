I shall honor my parents, teachers and elders
and be good to those, who are younger than me.
I shall do the best that I can to help all those people
who are old, poor, crippled or in distress
Everyday, I shall do atleast one good deed 
that will please my fellow human beings 
without any distinction of country, class, color or creed.
I shall try to make the college tradition Discipline and Hardwork 
and the college motto Character Is Destiny as a part and parcel of my life.
